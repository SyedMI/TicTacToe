# Tic-Tac-Toe Reinforcement Learning

## Description
This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using Reinforcement Learning.  
An agent is trained using the **Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)** algorithm to learn optimal strategies through repeated gameplay.  
The project also includes a **Minimax-based optimal opponent** for evaluation and supports **human vs AI gameplay**.

## Objectives
- Train a reinforcement learning agent to play Tic-Tac-Toe
- Apply **policy gradient methods** for decision making
- Compare agent performance against random and Minimax opponents
- Enable interactive human vs AI gameplay
